# Problems To Optimize Further

## LeetCode and Binary Search

| Problem Name | More optimization approach | What we are optimizing here |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| [Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Sub-arrays](https://github.com/gouravkhator/boat-to-cp/blob/main/LeetCode_and_BinarySearch/make_two_arrays_equal_by_reverse_subarray.java) |  | 
| [Letter Tile Possibilities](https://github.com/gouravkhator/boat-to-cp/blob/main/LeetCode_and_BinarySearch/letter_tile_possibilities.java) | | Time complexity drastically
| [Lowest Common Ancestor of Binary Tree]() | | Time complexity from current approach's 879 ms runtime (faster than just 5% in leetcode) to around 1 - 5 ms runtime
| [Sum of all Odd length subarrays]() | | Time complexity from current approach's O(n^2) to O(n)
| [Longest Valid Parentheses]() | | Time complexity from current O(n^2) to O(n)
