The Competitive Programming questions link with solved Java/Python solutions are written in this one single repository.

**\*NEW\* stuffs in this repo:**

- **Systems Design** - It includes problem statement, approach, hyperlinks, and much more.

  The whole Systems Design will be in **`.md`** file with proper formatting and so much fun.

- **Approached CP Problems but not yet solved** - It includes approach and code in the form of **.md** files for each question.
- **Leetcode DSA Sheet Topic-Wise PDF**, all credits to [Fraz Bhaiya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frazmohammad/), to crack FAANG Interviews, mainly Google. PDF shared in the root folder of this repo.
- **Templates for CP and DSA**:
  - [Java Template for CP](./java_template_cp.java)
  - [Rust Template for DSA mainly Leetcode](./rust_template_dsa.rs)

- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [OtherContest](./OtherContest/) - It has questions given in comments of the code itself, and in filename too.

  It also includes **Google Kickstart** problem sums, either solved fully by me, or inspired by others' approaches..

## Assumptions ü´£

Not all CP questions are uploaded here. I got some of the major platforms here, on which I code and keep a local copy of my solutions.

**Note: All the solutions are written in Java/Python/Rust.**

Some solutions were solved for some exams which I couldn't share.
