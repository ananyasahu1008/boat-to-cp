## Platforms Covered

## Assumptions

Not all CP questions are uploaded here. I got some of the major platforms here, on which I code and keep a local copy of my solutions. 

**Note: All the solutions are written in Java, my primary language of choice for CP or basic stuffs.**

Some solutions were solved for some exams which I couldn't share.
