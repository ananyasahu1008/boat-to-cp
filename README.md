* OtherContest - It has questions given in comments of the code itself, and in filename too. 
It also includes **Google Kickstart** problem sums, either solved fully by me, or inspired by others' approaches..

## Assumptions

Not all CP questions are uploaded here. I got some of the major platforms here, on which I code and keep a local copy of my solutions. 

**Note: All the solutions are written in Java/Python.**

Some solutions were solved for some exams which I couldn't share.
